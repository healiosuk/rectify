# # asdf config
#
# https://asdf-vm.com/ - Manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool
#
# This guide assumes you're running on a Mac, with Homebrew, and the default Mac zsh shell.
# If this is not your setup, then the asdf docs will be able to help you get setup:
# https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html
#
# 1. Install asdf
#    `brew install asdf`
#
# 2. Add to your environment:
#    `echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc`
#      - OR enable the asdf plugin for ohmyz.sh:
#    `https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/asdf`
#
# -- RESTART YOUR TERMINAL SESSION --
#
# 3. Add plugins dependencies
#    Node requires installation of gpg and gawk. Ruby requires OpenSSL.
#      `brew install gawk gpg openssl@1.1`
#
#    To prevent compiling a new copy of openssl with each new version of Ruby:
#      `echo -e '\nexport RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)"' >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc`
#
# 4. Add plugins
#    `asdf plugin add bundler`
#    `asdf plugin add nodejs`
#    `asdf plugin add ruby`
#    `asdf plugin add yarn`
#
# 5. Install your dependencies (from the repo root)
#    `asdf install`
#
# 6. Install your dependencies' dependencies:
#    `bundle`
#    `yarn`
#
# -- YOU'RE DONE --
#
bundler 2.4.18
ruby 2.7.8
